"""Integration tests for team cancellation with partial data preservation.

These tests verify that when a team run is cancelled mid-execution:
1. The partial content generated before cancellation is preserved
2. The team run status is set to cancelled
3. All partial data (content + messages) is stored in the database
4. Cancellation events are emitted properly
5. Resources are cleaned up properly
6. Both member and leader content is preserved
