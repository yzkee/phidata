"""Integration tests for continuing a paused team run with background=True and stream=True.

A background continue persists the team run as PENDING/RUNNING before its messages are
rebuilt, so the continued run must not be read back as its own history. Chat Completions rejects a
duplicated, unanswered tool call, so the bug makes the continue end in ERROR.
