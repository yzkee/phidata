class MMRReranker(Reranker):
    """Selects results that are relevant to the query but unlike each other.

    Plain vector search returns the closest matches, which are often near-duplicates of
    one another. MMR picks documents one at a time, discounting each candidate by how
    similar it already is to what has been selected.

    Requires an embedding on every candidate document. Verified against live backends:
    pgvector, Qdrant (vector and hybrid), Chroma and LanceDB return them; Milvus,
    MongoDB, Redis, Valkey and Qdrant keyword search do not, and MMR raises there rather
    than returning an unreranked list. Pinecone omits vectors unless the store is built
    with return_vectors=True.

    It also needs an embedder to embed the query. Vector dbs that embed queries
    themselves (Upstash hosted embeddings) expose none, so MMR cannot run there.

    The query is embedded with the embedder attached to the search results, so it always
    uses the same model the documents were indexed with.

    Returned documents are shallow copies carrying the MMR score; meta_data and embedding
    are shared with the inputs.

    Do not re-sort the result by reranking_score. Other rerankers score each document
    independently, so their order can be rebuilt from the scores; MMR chooses each
    document against the ones already chosen, so its scores are not descending and
    sorting by them discards the diversity ordering.
