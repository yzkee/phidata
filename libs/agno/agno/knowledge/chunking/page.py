Docs Chunking
=============

A heading-aware markdown chunker and reader.

MarkdownChunking depends on `unstructured` (a very large dependency tree) and
its base strategy collapses whitespace, which flattens code examples onto one
line. This chunker keeps newlines exactly as written.

Rules:
- Split on H1/H2 headings; deeper headings stay with their section.
- A section that holds nothing but headings (a title followed straight by its
  first H2) is folded into the next section, so no chunk is a bare heading;
  a page that is only a title yields no chunks at all.
- A section longer than CHUNK_SIZE is split on paragraph boundaries (and, as a
  last resort, on lines), never mid-line. A fenced code block longer than
  CHUNK_SIZE is split on lines too, with the fence closed and re-opened in
  each piece, so every chunk is valid markdown and fits the embedding limit.
- Every chunk starts with the page's context line — "Page title: its first
  paragraph" — and a breadcrumb line — "Page title › Section" — so the
  embedding of a section carries what the page is about and the agent sees
  where a chunk lives. (A section of an overview page is often a list of
  links; without the context line it never matches the question the page
  answers.) The fumadocs site's `# Title (/docs/path)` and `## Heading
  [#anchor]` suffixes are stripped from breadcrumbs (chunk bodies keep the raw
  lines).
- Chunk metadata carries the breadcrumb, the page's top-level `section`
  (`agents`, `examples`, ...) and its `kind`: `example` (under /examples or a
  usage/ folder), `reference` (/reference, /reference-api) or `guide`.
