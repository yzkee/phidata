        # a recorded cancel (intent outlives a cancelled-while-queued
        # tombstone: nothing executed, so nothing cleaned it up; TTL bounds
        # it at ~24h). Without the flag the re-driven attempt is re-cancelled
        # at its first checkpoint, visibly - annoying but never wrong.
        #
        # The override is STATE-GATED and coupled to the transition:
        # 1) Gate: only a currently-requeueable (failed/cancelled) job may
        #    have intent cleared. Intent can only target a LIVE attempt, and
        #    live attempts exist only on running/queued/paused tickets - so
        #    rejecting those up front, WITHOUT touching intent, makes the
        #    dangerous class (erasing a running attempt's cancel and then
        #    400ing) unreachable.
        # 2) Clear BEFORE the requeue CAS: cleared after it, the clear could
        #    be delayed past a worker's claim and a fresh cancel of the
        #    re-driven attempt - the erase-a-newer-cancel window again.
        #    Cleared first, the ticket only becomes claimable once the
        #    override already happened.
        # 3) Clear failure ABORTS (503, nothing requeued): the operator asked
        #    for clear+requeue and must get both or neither - a silent
        #    requeue-without-clear would insta-cancel the re-driven attempt
        #    while reporting the override succeeded.
        # Residual (documented, accepted): between the gate read and the
        # clear, a CONCURRENT requeue + claim + fresh cancel could interleave
        # and be erased - cross-store atomicity between the job store and the
        # cancellation manager does not exist (same constraint as the sweep).
