"""StudioTools -- give agents the ability to compose agents, teams, and workflows.

Uses the AgentOS Registry (tools, models, dbs, functions) and the core
component APIs (Agent, Team, Workflow, Step) to dynamically create, edit,
version, and execute components described in natural language.

Typical use:
    from agno.tools.studio import StudioTools

    studio_agent = Agent(
        model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
        tools=[StudioTools(registry=registry, db=db)],
    )

    studio_agent.print_response(
        "Create an agent named 'math-tutor' that uses claude-sonnet-4-5 and "
        "the calculator toolkit."
    )

Semantics:
    * create_* persists a new component with a single published config.
    * edit_* loads the component, applies the patch, and saves it:
      - with versions=True the edit is saved as a draft (an existing draft is
        updated in place; otherwise a new draft version is created). Use
        publish_component() to promote the draft to published+current.
      - with versions=False (default) the edit is published immediately as a
        new current version. Each edit creates a new published version; prior
        versions remain in history (they are immutable).
    * run_* execute a component as the current user, with one sub-session per
      calling conversation and PAUSED results that carry their unresolved
      requirements. The implementation is StudioRunnerTools
      (agno.tools.studio_runner), which platforms can also mount standalone
      as a dispatch-only surface -- discovery and execution without the
      Studio's mutation tools.

Enable flags:
    * Default: only agent operations are exposed (agents=True, teams=False,
      workflows=False). Discovery functions are always available.
    * Pass teams=True / workflows=True to also expose those operations.
    * Passing agents=False without enabling teams or workflows leaves only
      discovery tools registered.
    * Passing agents_list auto-enables teams and workflows (you can build them
      from those agents). Passing teams_list auto-enables workflows. Explicit
      False overrides the auto-enable.
    * Versioning tools (list_versions, get_version, publish_component,
      set_current_version, delete_version) are exposed only when versions=True.
    * Schedule tools (create_schedule, list_schedules, get_schedule,
      get_schedule_runs, trigger_schedule, enable_schedule, disable_schedule,
      delete_schedule) are exposed only when schedules=True. create_schedule is
      Studio's own (component-aware targets); the management tools are shared
      with SchedulerTools.

Persistence:
    * Studio saves ONLY the component it creates/edits. It does NOT cascade to
      member agents or step agents -- those are assumed to be code-defined
      (registry / passed-in lists) or separately persisted by a prior create_*.

class StudioTools(Toolkit):
    """Toolkit that lets an agent compose agents, teams, and workflows.

    Args:
        registry: Registry holding models, tools, databases, and code-defined
            agents/teams available for composition.
        db: Database for persisting components. Falls back to ``registry.dbs[0]``.
        agents_list: Optional live list (e.g. ``agent_os.agents``) used only for
            discovery in ``list_agents()``. Studio-created components are NOT
            appended to this list -- they are DB components, so appending would
            duplicate them in AgentOS's ``/agents`` response.
        teams_list: Same as ``agents_list`` but for teams.
        workflows_list: Same as ``agents_list`` but for workflows.
        default_model_id: Model id to use when a caller omits one.
        default_num_history_runs: History depth for created agents and teams
            when a caller omits ``num_history_runs``. None lets the
            component's own default apply.
        agents: Expose agent operations. Defaults to True.
        teams: Expose team operations. Defaults to False (see module docstring
            for auto-enable rules).
        workflows: Expose workflow operations. Defaults to False.
        versions: Expose versioning tools (list_versions, get_version,
            publish_component, set_current_version, delete_version). Defaults
            to False; without versioning, edits publish immediately instead of
            producing drafts.
        list_limit: Cap on DB components returned by each list tool (default
            100). The list payloads report 'db_total' so a capped list is
            visible as capped.
        schedules: Expose schedule tools: Studio's own create_schedule
            (component-aware targets) plus the SchedulerTools management tools
            (list_schedules, get_schedule, get_schedule_runs, trigger_schedule,
            enable_schedule, disable_schedule, delete_schedule). Defaults to
            False. Requires the optional scheduler dependencies (croniter and
            pytz -- ``pip install agno[scheduler]``); when they are missing,
            the first schedule tool call that needs them returns an error JSON.
