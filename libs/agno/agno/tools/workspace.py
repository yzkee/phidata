class Workspace(Toolkit):
    """Local-machine toolkit for read/write/edit/search/shell access to a directory tree.

    All file operations are scoped to ``root`` — paths that resolve outside it are
    rejected with an error. Shell commands run with ``cwd=root``. This is a path-scoping
    boundary, not a process sandbox: the agent can still read environment variables,
    make network calls via shell tools, and use whatever the host process can use. For
    untrusted code execution, run the agent inside a real sandbox (container, VM, or
    a service like Daytona).

    Permission model — ``allowed`` and ``confirm`` are mutually exclusive
    partitions of short aliases:

    - An alias in ``allowed`` runs silently.
    - An alias in ``confirm`` requires user approval (Agno's HITL pause/resume).
    - An alias in **neither** list is not registered with the toolkit — the LLM doesn't see it.
    - An alias in **both** lists raises ``ValueError``.

    Aliases (the strings you put in the lists) are short for the snippet; the actual method
    names registered with the LLM are descriptive so the tool spec is self-explanatory:

    | Alias    | Registered tool name | What it does                            |
    | -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | ``read``   | ``read_file``        | Read a file (line-numbered)             |
    | ``list``   | ``list_files``       | List a directory (recursive option)     |
    | ``search`` | ``search_content``   | Recursive content grep                  |
    | ``write``  | ``write_file``       | Create or overwrite a file (atomic)     |
    | ``edit``   | ``edit_file``        | Replace a substring (with ``replace_all``)|
    | ``move``   | ``move_file``        | Move or rename a file                   |
    | ``delete`` | ``delete_file``      | Delete a file                           |
    | ``shell``  | ``run_command``      | Run a shell command in ``root``         |

    Defaults:

    - When both lists are ``None``: reads (``read``, ``list``, ``search``) auto-pass,
      writes (``write``, ``edit``, ``move``, ``delete``, ``shell``) require confirmation.
      This is the safe-by-default surface meant for the homepage demo.
    - When only one is set: the other defaults to ``[]`` — you've taken control,
      and the surface is exactly what you specified.

    ``exclude_patterns`` is an access boundary for every path the agent names. A path is
    excluded when any component of the path as written, or of the file it resolves to,
    matches a pattern. Excluded paths are hidden from ``list_files`` and ``search_content``
    and are refused by ``read_file``, ``write_file``, ``edit_file``, ``move_file`` (source
    and destination), and ``delete_file`` with
    ``Error: <argument> is excluded from this workspace: <path>``. Naming an excluded
    directory in ``list_files`` or ``search_content`` is refused the same way. On a
    case-insensitive filesystem (macOS and Windows defaults) patterns match
    case-insensitively, so ``.ENV`` is refused there and a file stored as ``BUILD``
    matches the pattern ``build``. Each pattern matches one path component; a pattern
    containing a path separator raises ``ValueError``. Hard links to an excluded file are
    not detected. The default set covers common noise directories
    (``.venv``, ``.venvs``, ``.context``, ``.git``, ``__pycache__``, ``node_modules``,
    etc.), env files (``.env*``, ``*.env``) and the credential files a repository or a
    home directory conventionally holds — private keys and keystores (``*.pem``,
    ``*.key``, ``id_rsa*``), credential directories (``.ssh``, ``.aws``, ``.kube``),
    registry and host tokens (``.npmrc``, ``.netrc``, ``.git-credentials``), credential
    data files (``credentials.json``, ``secrets.yaml``, ``service_account*.json``) and
    Terraform inputs (``*.tfvars``). Deliberately absent are ``credentials.*`` and
    ``secrets.*``, which would also refuse ordinary source such as ``credentials.py``.
    Pass ``exclude_patterns=[...]`` to override, or ``exclude_patterns=[]`` to disable.

    An entry prefixed with ``!`` is an exemption: a component matching it is never
    excluded, whatever else it matches. The defaults use this to keep committed env
    templates readable (``!.env.example``, ``!.env.sample``, ``!.env.template``,
    ``!.env.dist``, ``!example.env``, ``!env.example``) while real env files stay
    refused. Exemptions are order-independent and always win; a bare ``!`` raises
    ``ValueError``. To drop them, filter the defaults:
    ``[p for p in DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS if not p.startswith("!")]``.

    ``allow_paths`` names workspace-relative files or directories that stay visible and
    reachable even when they match an exclude pattern, for example ``[".env.example"]``.
    Entries are literal paths, not patterns. A directory entry covers the files beneath
    it, and exclude patterns still apply to names beneath the entry:
    ``allow_paths=["build"]`` reaches ``build/index.html`` but not ``build/.env``. An
    allowed path beneath an excluded directory is reachable by name; recursive listings
    still prune the excluded directory.

    ``run_command`` runs a process with ``cwd=root`` and is outside the path and exclude
    checks; gate it with ``confirm``.

    Optional ``require_read_before_write=True`` blocks ``write_file`` / ``edit_file`` /
    ``move_file`` / ``delete_file`` on existing files until the agent has read them in
    this session. Catches the "agent hallucinated the file's contents" bug class.
