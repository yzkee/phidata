"""StudioRunnerTools -- discovery and execution over Studio-built components.

The runner is the dispatch half of the Studio: list the agents, teams, and
workflows this runner can run -- those in the platform database, plus any
code-defined components it admits -- and run one by id. It carries no
create/edit/delete surface, so it is safe to mount on any component that should
hand work to built components -- a team lead, a router -- without granting the
Studio's mutation tools.

Typical use:
    from agno.tools.studio_runner import StudioRunnerTools

    lead = Team(
        model=...,
        members=[...],
        tools=[StudioRunnerTools(registry=registry, db=db)],
    )

Mount it INSTEAD of StudioTools, not beside it. StudioTools embeds this same
toolkit and already exposes list_agents/list_teams/list_workflows/run_agent,
plus run_team and run_workflow once teams or workflows are enabled (an explicit
include_agents enables both), and agno's tool namespace is flat: co-mounting
collapses the overlapping names to
whichever toolkit the tools list holds first, and a warning names the skipped
one. Two runners scoped to different component lists collapse the same way, so
the loser's allowlist becomes unreachable. ``name=`` names the toolkit, not its
functions, so it does not disambiguate them.

Semantics:
    * Everything runnable is discoverable: list_* report the components in the
      platform database plus the code-defined ones this runner admits, and a
      display name never reaches a stored component whose id a code-defined
      one holds -- one id means one component, however it was spelled.
    * Runs execute as the current user: the wielding component's run_context is
      injected and its user_id passed through, so per-user state (memory,
      learning) lands on the human who asked, never on a service default.
    * Each target keeps one session per calling conversation: the session id
      is a digest keyed on the caller's session id, the component type and
      the component id (see _sub_session_id), so repeat runs continue their
      context instead of starting cold. A caller with no session of its own
      (a direct Python call) passes no session id -- and because dispatch
      runs on a per-call copy or rebuild, each such run starts a session of
      its own. Construct the component with an explicit session_id to keep
      continuity across sessionless calls.
    * Code-defined components are dispatched on a fresh deep copy per run, so
      per-run mutation of a shared instance never bleeds across callers.
      DB-loaded components are reconstructed per call already. Two things sit
      outside that copy, both by the framework's own rules:
        - what a callable members/tools/steps factory returns, since it is
          built per run and cached while cache_callables is on. Dispatch warns
          when it meets one.
        - a tool whose ``__deepcopy__`` returns self or raises. An ordinary
          toolkit is deep-copied like any other object and is NOT shared; it is
          only these two that the field-level fallback keeps by reference, so a
          toolkit holding per-call state that way is shared between callers.
          Returning self is a deliberate choice; raising is not, and that half
          is a swallowed failure (#9445).
    * A PAUSED result carries the unresolved requirements plus the
      run_id/session_id a continue call must address (the same shape the
      AgentOS MCP plane returns) -- human-in-the-loop pauses are relayed.
    * Runs are dispatched with stream=False pinned: run-option resolution is
      call-site > component.stream > False, so a component saved with
      stream=True still hands back its final run output, never an unconsumed
      event iterator.
    * run_* resolve in a fixed order: code-defined exact id, DB exact id,
      code-defined display name, DB display name, then the identifier's slug
      as an id (covers renamed components, whose ids keep the original
      name's slug). Exact ids always win over display names. A display name
      matching several components of the type returns an error listing the
      matching ids.
    * Persisted components rebuild from their stored config. Registry-backed
      references (tools, knowledge, function steps, schemas, code-defined
      members) require the registry: without it the runner refuses to run a
      silently degraded component. A registry that is present but does not
      hold a referenced piece is refused the same way -- the rebuilt component
      is checked against its own config before dispatch, so an unresolved tool
      or a dropped schema stops the run rather than quietly changing what it
      does. Reads and edits load it either way, so it stays repairable.
      Member references resolve at their current
      published version. Model connection settings, credentials and a
      declared db are not fully persisted, so a rebuild can fall back to
      provider defaults and to the catalog db; the runner logs a warning for
      the dispatched agent's or team's own model and for a dropped db.
    * list_* read the database only (id, name, description, newest first), and
      run_* dispatch that same set: a component you cannot list is a component
      you cannot run. Code-defined components arrive through the registry,
      which is passed so persisted components can rehydrate rather than to
      grant the runner the run of the application, so dispatching them is
      opt-in via include_all_components. An explicit include_agents/include_teams/
      include_workflows is itself the allowlist and always runs. 'total' reports
      the full DB count, so a capped list is visible as capped.

StudioTools embeds this toolkit for its own run_* tools and delegates its
component lookups here, so a builder's smoke-test runs and a dispatcher's
production runs share one implementation.
