"""
Learning Demo: Seed Data
========================
Runs a few short conversations through the ops assistant so that every
Learning page in AgentOS has data: user profiles, user memories, session
context, entity memories, and decision logs. It also seeds a learned
knowledge insight that one user teaches and another benefits from.

Requires the pgvector container:
    ./cookbook/scripts/run_pgvector.sh

Run:
    .venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/08_learning/10_demo/seed.py

Then start the AgentOS server with run.py and connect from os.agno.com.
