"""
Learning Demo: AgentOS Server
=============================
Serves the ops assistant on an AgentOS instance, which exposes the
/learnings CRUD endpoints and powers the Learning pages at os.agno.com.

Requires the pgvector container:
    ./cookbook/scripts/run_pgvector.sh

Run seed.py first so the Learning pages have data:
    .venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/08_learning/10_demo/seed.py

Then start the server:
    .venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/08_learning/10_demo/run.py

Then open https://os.agno.com, connect to http://localhost:7777, and
browse the Learning section: User Profiles, User Memories, Entity
Memories, Session Context, and Decision Logs.

Interactive API docs are at http://localhost:7777/docs.
