"""
Test replay functionality - reconnecting to a COMPLETED workflow.

This test verifies:
1. Workflow runs to completion
2. All events are stored
3. Reconnecting after completion triggers REPLAY
4. ALL events are sent (not just missed ones)
5. last_event_index is ignored during replay

Usage:
    1. Start server: python cookbook/agent_os/workflow/basic_workflow.py
    2. Run this test: python cookbook/workflows/_06_advanced_concepts/_07_long_running_workflows/02_workflow_events_replay.py
