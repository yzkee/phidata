Date: January 15, 2025

DISCUSSION
----------

Sarah opened the meeting by reviewing the Q4 roadmap. The main priorities are:
- Launch the new dashboard feature by end of February
- Complete the API v2 migration
- Improve system performance by 30%

Mike raised concerns about the February deadline for the dashboard. The team is currently
understaffed with two engineers on leave. He proposed either extending the deadline to
mid-March or bringing in a contractor.

Lisa presented the updated dashboard designs. The stakeholders approved the mockups last
week. She noted that the design system components are ready and can be handed off to
engineering immediately.

Tom mentioned that the current test coverage is at 67%. He recommends increasing it to
at least 80% before the dashboard launch. This will require approximately 2 weeks of
dedicated QA effort.

The team discussed the API v2 migration timeline. Currently, 40% of clients have migrated.
The target is 90% by end of Q1. Marketing will send reminder communications next week.

DECISIONS
---------
- Dashboard deadline extended to March 15
- Will hire one contractor for 3 months (Mike to coordinate with HR by Jan 20)
- QA sprint scheduled for Feb 1-14
