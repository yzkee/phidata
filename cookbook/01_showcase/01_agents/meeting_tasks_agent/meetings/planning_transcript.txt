Topic: Q1 Feature Priorities

---

PM: Alright everyone, let's go through our Q1 priorities. The main focus is improving user onboarding.

Engineering Lead: Agreed. We've been seeing a 40% drop-off in the first week. Sarah, can you take the lead on the new onboarding flow implementation?

Sarah: Sure, I can start on that. When do we need it done?

PM: Ideally by end of February. So about 6 weeks.

Sarah: That's doable. I'll need to work with design first. Let me schedule a kickoff with them this week.

Engineering Lead: Great. Mike, we also need to address the performance issues users have been reporting.

Mike: Yeah, I've been looking into it. The main bottleneck is the dashboard loading time. I'll need to refactor the data fetching logic.

PM: How long do you think that will take?

Mike: Probably 2 weeks for the initial optimization. I should create a ticket for that.

PM: Perfect. Action item for Mike: create the performance optimization ticket by tomorrow.

Engineering Lead: John, what's the status on the API v2 migration?

John: We're about 60% done. The main blocker is the authentication endpoint - we need to coordinate with the mobile team.

PM: Let's get that scheduled. John, can you reach out to the mobile team lead by end of day?

John: Will do.

Engineering Lead: One more thing - we need someone to review our test coverage. It's been slipping.

PM: Lisa, can you take that on?

Lisa: Sure. I'll do an audit this sprint and create tickets for any gaps.

PM: Great, let's aim to have the audit done by next Friday.
