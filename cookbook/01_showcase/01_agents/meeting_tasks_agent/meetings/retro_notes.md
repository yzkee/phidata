# Sprint Retrospective

**Sprint:** January 2026
**Date:** January 10, 2026

## What Went Well

- Shipped the new search feature on time
- Great collaboration between frontend and backend teams

## What Could Be Improved

- Too many context switches due to urgent bugs
- Code review turnaround time is slow (3+ days average)
- Documentation is falling behind
- Sprint scope changed mid-sprint

## Action Items from Retrospective

### Process Improvements

1. **Code Review SLA** - Sarah will propose a new code review SLA (24-hour turnaround) and present to team by next Monday

2. **Bug Triage Process** - Mike to create a bug triage rotation schedule to prevent context switching. Should be ready before next sprint.

3. **Scope Change Policy** - PM will draft a scope change policy requiring sign-off for mid-sprint changes. Due by Friday.

### Technical Debt

4. **Documentation Sprint** - Team agrees to dedicate 20% of next sprint to documentation. John to create documentation tickets by end of day.

5. **Test Coverage** - Lisa identified we need more integration tests for the payment module. Create ticket and prioritize for next sprint.

### Quick Wins

6. **Slack Channel Cleanup** - Sarah to archive unused channels this week
7. **CI/CD Improvements** - Mike found some build optimization opportunities. TODO: Create spike ticket to investigate.

## Priorities for Next Sprint
