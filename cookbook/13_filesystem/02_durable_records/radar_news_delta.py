"""
Durable Records - Radar News Delta
==================================
A scheduled news-brief agent that reports only what is new since its last
run. The seen-list is date-partitioned, one file per day under seen/, so you
can delete old partitions without touching recent state.

This example runs the agent twice over a growing feed. Run 1 briefs
everything, run 2 briefs only the two new stories.
