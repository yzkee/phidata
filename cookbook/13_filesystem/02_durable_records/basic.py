"""
Durable Records - Basic
=======================
Deduplicate work with a record log. The agent calls check_lines before it
acts and append_file after. The log matches on exact lines and outlives the
process, so a recurring job never repeats work it has already done.

This example processes two overlapping ticket batches. The second pass acts
only on the genuinely new ticket.
