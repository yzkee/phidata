"""
FileSystem - Basic
==================
Give your agent a durable, private filesystem. Attach its tools, pass its
instructions along with your own, and anything the agent writes stays
available in every future run.

Run this file twice. Run 1 writes a note. Run 2 is a new process with no
shared session, and it reads the note back.
