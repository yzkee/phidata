"""
Operations - Quota Recovery
===========================
FileSystem caps the size of every file and every namespace, and nothing is
ever evicted silently. This example hits both caps on purpose, shows the
guidance the agent gets back, and then recovers programmatically: starting
a new partition and deleting old ones through the Python API (the delete
tool itself is opt-in via tools(allow_delete=True)).

The caps are set very small here so the numbers stay readable. No model, no
API keys.
