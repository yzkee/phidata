"""
Working State - Basic
=====================
Checkpoint progress to a file so long work can resume later. The agent
records where it stopped in state/checkpoint.md, and the next session reads
that file to pick up from the same point.

This example runs a four-step task as two sessions of two steps each. The
second session shares no history with the first. To see the same thing hold
across processes, see 01_getting_started/basic.py.
