# Test Log

### structured_content.py

**Status:** PASS

**Description:** Connects to the hosted DeepWiki MCP server (public, no auth) and asks
about facebook/react. Verifies the agent answers from the tool's `structuredContent`
and that `structured_content_hook` reads the typed object from
`ToolResult.metadata["structured_content"]`.

**Result:** `ask_question` returned successfully (with `timeout_seconds=60` for DeepWiki's
slower analysis), the hook printed the `structured_content` payload read from metadata, and
the agent produced a grounded one-sentence answer about the repository.
