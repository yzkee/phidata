Nested Workflow Example

This example demonstrates how to use a workflow as a step within another workflow.
This is useful for composing complex workflows from simpler, reusable sub-workflows.

In this example:
- We create an "inner" workflow that performs a simple research task
- We create an "outer" workflow that uses the inner workflow as one of its steps
- The outer workflow orchestrates multiple steps including the nested workflow
