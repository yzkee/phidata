# Studio

`StudioTools` lets an Agent compose persisted Agents, Teams, and Workflows from
the live objects in an AgentOS `Registry`, and `StudioRunnerTools` dispatches
what was built. This lesson separates five concerns: standalone composition,
composition served by AgentOS, human-in-the-loop control, dispatch, and the
Registry/Components HTTP contracts.

## Files

| File | What it teaches |
|---|---|
| `standalone_studio_agent.py` | Create, edit, inspect, and publish a versioned Agent without starting AgentOS. |
| `studio_tools_agent.py` | Serve a Studio Agent beside code-defined Agents and create a component over HTTP. |
| `studio_hitl_agent.py` | Resolve structured feedback, free-text input, and confirmation pauses in a console process. |
| `studio_hitl_agent_os.py` | Resolve the same pauses through AgentOS run and continuation endpoints. |
| `registry_and_components.py` | Read `GET /registry` and complete a persisted component CRUD lifecycle. |
| `studio_runner_dispatcher.py` | Dispatch Studio-built components from a runner-only Agent with `StudioRunnerTools`. |
| `studio_runner_direct.py` | Call the runner's list/run tools directly and observe the registry guard's refusal. |

## Prerequisites

Set up the cookbook environment and provider keys:

```bash
./scripts/demo_setup.sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

All examples use synchronous `SqliteDb` databases under `22_studio/tmp/`.
StudioTools persistence and the `/components` router require a synchronous
`BaseDb`. If AgentOS receives an async database, it exposes a disabled
`/components` surface instead. `GET /registry` is independent of component
persistence and only requires `AgentOS(registry=...)`.

## Run standalone composition

The standalone example uses `claude-sonnet-4-6` as the Studio Agent and carries
out a full published-v1 to draft-v2 to published-v2 lifecycle:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/standalone_studio_agent.py
```

`versions=True` is opt-in. With it, `edit_agent`, `edit_team`, and
`edit_workflow` write a draft that `publish_component` must promote. Without
versioning, edits publish a new current version immediately.

## Run the AgentOS Studio Agent

Start the server:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_tools_agent.py
```

Then run its repeatable HTTP client from another terminal:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_tools_agent.py --demo
```

Each server defaults to port 7777. Set `PORT` for the server and
`AGENT_OS_BASE_URL` for its client when that port is already occupied.

Passing `agents_list` to `StudioTools` makes those code-defined Agents available
to Team and Workflow composition and auto-enables their operations. A
Studio-created component is persisted in the database; it is not appended to
the code-defined Agent list.

## Run the dispatcher

`StudioRunnerTools` is the dispatch half of the Studio: it lists the components
in the platform database and runs one by id, with no create/edit/delete
surface. Mount it on a router or team lead that should hand work to built
components without holding the Studio's mutation tools. Runs execute as the
current user, keep one session per component per conversation, pin
`stream=False`, and relay PAUSED results with their requirements.

Mount it instead of `StudioTools`, not alongside it. The two share `list_agents`,
`list_teams`, `list_workflows` and `run_agent`, plus `run_team` and
`run_workflow` once teams or workflows are enabled (passing an `agents_list`
enables both), and the tool namespace is flat, so the toolkit listed first wins
those names and the other is skipped with a warning.

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_runner_dispatcher.py
```

The direct example calls the same tools as plain methods and shows the
registry guard: a runner constructed without the registry refuses components
whose stored configs reference registry-backed resources (tools, knowledge,
code-defined members), because the rebuild would silently drop them.

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_runner_direct.py
```

## Console versus AgentOS HITL

The pause/resume mechanics used here (`RunRequirement`, `continue_run`, the
`/continue` route) are taught in
[`../05_human_in_the_loop/`](../05_human_in_the_loop/); this folder only
applies them to Studio composition.

Both HITL examples deliberately start with only a component name. The Studio
Agent must:

1. ask a structured, multi-select tool question;
2. request free-text Agent instructions;
3. pause for confirmation on the exact `create_agent` call.

The console lesson resolves live `RunRequirement` objects and calls
`Agent.continue_run()`:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_hitl_agent.py
```

Use the deterministic answers used by the test log:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_hitl_agent.py --auto
```

The AgentOS lesson serializes paused executions in the run's `tools` array.
Start it, then run the client in another terminal:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_hitl_agent_os.py
```

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/studio_hitl_agent_os.py --demo
```

The client fills `selected_options` or user-input `value`, sets `answered`, and
finally sets `confirmed=true` before sending the updated tools to
`POST /agents/{agent_id}/runs/{run_id}/continue`.

## Registry and Components APIs

Start the catalog server:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/registry_and_components.py
```

Run its live CRUD client:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/22_studio/registry_and_components.py --demo
```

The two surfaces have different ownership:

- `GET /registry` describes live, code-defined tools, models, databases,
  schemas, functions, and reusable components. It is read-only and supports
  `resource_type`, partial `name`, `page`, and `limit` filters.
- `/components` owns persisted component metadata and versioned configuration.
  The example executes `POST /components`, filtered `GET /components`,
  `GET /components/{id}`, `PATCH /components/{id}`,
  `GET /components/{id}/configs/current`, and `DELETE /components/{id}`.

The Components API also provides config-version create, read, update, delete,
and set-current routes. Published configs are immutable; draft configs can be
updated or deleted, and only a published version can become current.
