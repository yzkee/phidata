# AgentOS Cookbook

AgentOS is a FastAPI-based runtime that turns agents, teams, workflows, and
knowledge into roughly 80 REST endpoints and makes them available to the
[AgentOS control plane](https://os.agno.com). The same runtime can also expose
MCP, A2A, AG-UI, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp interfaces.

## Start here

Run the smallest useful AgentOS:

```bash
.venvs/demo/bin/python cookbook/05_agent_os/basic.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:7777/config](http://localhost:7777/config).
`GET /config` is the payoff: it describes the registered agent, model,
database, domains, and enabled interfaces that clients and the control plane
can use. Open `/openapi.json` or `/docs` to inspect the complete REST route
surface.

## One agent, several interfaces

An agent does not have to belong to only one protocol. The same object can be
mounted on several interfaces without duplicating its instructions, tools, or
state:

```python
from agno.os.interfaces.a2a import A2A
from agno.os.interfaces.agui import AGUI
from agno.os.interfaces.slack import Slack

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[agent],
    interfaces=[
        A2A(agents=[agent]),
        AGUI(agent=agent, prefix="/agui"),
        Slack(agent=agent),
    ],
)
```

The cookbook teaches those interfaces separately so each example has honest
credentials and a focused test surface; it deliberately does not ship one
all-credentials demo.
