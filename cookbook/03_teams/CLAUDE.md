## Testing Priorities

### High Priority
- `basic_flows/` - Core team patterns
- `state/` - Shared state management
- `streaming/` - Event handling

### Medium Priority
- `knowledge/` - RAG with teams
- `memory/` - Persistent memory
- `hooks/` - Production patterns

---

## API Keys Required

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Most examples
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Multimodal examples

---

## Known Issues

1. Team model inherits to members by default
2. Share member interactions requires explicit flag
3. Multimodal requires local media files
