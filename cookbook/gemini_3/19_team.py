"""
Multi-Agent Team - Writer, Editor, and Fact-Checker
=====================================================
Coordinate specialized agents with a team leader. Writer drafts, Editor refines, Fact-Checker verifies.

Key concepts:
- Team: Coordinates multiple agents, each with a specific role
- Team leader: An LLM (typically a stronger model) that delegates to members
- members: List of Agent instances the team can delegate to
- show_members_responses: If True, shows each member's response in the output
- role: A short description of what each member agent does (helps the leader delegate)

Example prompts to try:
- "Write a blog post about the health benefits of Mediterranean diet"
- "Create an article about the future of AI in healthcare"
- "Write a travel guide for visiting Tokyo in cherry blossom season"

Team patterns:

1. Research team (search + analysis)
   members=[researcher, analyst, summarizer]

2. Code review team (write + review + test)
   members=[coder, reviewer, tester]

3. Creative team (ideate + create + critique)
   members=[brainstormer, creator, critic]

When to use teams vs single agents:
- Single agent: Task is well-defined, one perspective is enough
- Team: Task benefits from multiple specialist perspectives
- Workflow (step 20): Steps must happen in a specific, predictable order

Use cases for music/film/gaming:
- Music: Lyricist + Composer + Producer agents
- Film: Scriptwriter + Director + Continuity Checker agents
- Gaming: Designer + Artist + QA Tester agents
